Training repo for Tennis Game Kata:

The goal is to implement a ScoreBoard for a Tennis Game using TDD.

### Rules:

- Each player can have either of these points in one game “love” “15” “30” “40”
- If you have 40 and you win the point you win the game, however there are special rules.
- If both have 40 the players are “deuce”.
- If the game is in deuce, the winner of a point will have advantage
- If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game
- If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.
